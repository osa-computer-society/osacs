# 4. Minecraft!!!

Today we went over how to host your own Minecraft server! \(Sorry if you don't have the game! There's a lot of cool networking concepts to be learned.\)

Check out the tutorial here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/azure/reference-architectures/multiplayer-basic-game-server-hosting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/azure/reference-architectures/multiplayer-basic-game-server-hosting)

We also discussed modding using PaperMC, which uses an API to interact with Java.

To work with Java projects, we strongly recommend using IntelliJ IDEA, an IDE that will greatly speed up your coding process! You can install it here: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
