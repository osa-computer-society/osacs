# Resources

Have something you want to see here? [Let us know!](mailto:a.cai6@share.epsb.ca) This page is a work in progress.

## Misc

Before you go browsing, remember that the Internet is quite literally _gigantic!_ Find a good resource and focus on it instead of wasting your time.

* [Ryan's Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/)
  * A great site to learn about all sorts of programming topics.
* [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome): ðŸ˜Ž Awesome lists about all kinds of interesting topics
  * [awesome-algorithms](https://github.com/tayllan/awesome-algorithms): A further list of awesome things about algorithms.
* [Repl.it](https://repl.it/): An online code editor that allows you to quickly and easily write and share code.
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/): has a variety of really good courses. Unfortunately, they've recently put a lot of their content behind a paywall, but there's still a lot of useful free lessons, especially [Learn How to Code](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-how-to-code) if you're new to programming.
* [https://codecombat.com/](https://codecombat.com/)

## Language-Specific

See our [Tools of the Trade](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10lPVhpyD0kqjodi21XNZE314M5Xc3TOms6DYMfglyEI/edit?usp=sharing) file for information on various IDEs.

### Processing

[Hello Processing](https://hello.processing.org/): An amazing set of video tutorials by Daniel Shiffman \(the creator of Processing\) on getting started with the language.

### Web development

[MDN Tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Tutorials): the Mozilla Development Network is essentially the ultimate authority on all things web, and their tutorials are just as amazing!

## Contests

\(Organized Alphabetically\)

You can find a more comprehensive list [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming). [Let us know](mailto:a.cai6@share.epsb.ca) about any competitions you write and we'll see if we can help you organize it!

### [USACO](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=instructions)

* [Their training website](https://train.usaco.org/usacogate) offers a personalized curriculum.
* Often features more ad hoc-style problems that test your problem-solving skills rather than memorization of key algorithms.

## Design

[Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

* A great place to learn CSS Flexbox.

[Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)

* A great place to learn CSS Grid.

## Books

### [Programming Challenges by Skiena and Revila](http://acm.cs.buap.mx/downloads/Programming_Challenges.pdf)

There are many questions throughout that allow you to test your knowledge of algorithms and it covers each topic very thoroughly.

1. Getting started
2. Data Structures
3. Strings
4. Sorting
5. Arithmetic and Algebra
6. Combinatorics
7. Number Theory
8. Backtracking
9. Graph Traversal
10. Graph Algorithms
11. Dynamic Programming
12. Grids
13. Geometry
14. Computational Geometry

### [Introduction to Algorithms \(CLRS\)](https://ms.sapientia.ro/~kasa/Algorithms_3rd.pdf)

This is known as the quintessential algorithms textbook. It's over 1000 pages long, but very helpful and begins right from the basics!

## Practice Problems

### [99 problems](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/)

Originally written for Prolog but theyâ€™re just questions and can be solved with any language. Starts really easy but gets pretty in depth, with stuff like binary trees and graph theory like problems.

### [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

These are more math-oriented problems, but they're a great way to get started with creative problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

### [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)

Kattis is a great collection of a gigantic variety of problems.

### [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

Codewars has an ever-expanding collection of problems that are created by its users and can be translated into different languages by them as well.

### [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/)

* Contests: \(Outdated\)
* October 10: SRM 768 - Sponsored by Google
* October 19: SRM 769
* etc.

### [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/)

* Here you can find an easy-to-access collection of problems from a wide variety of contests, including all past CCCs.

### [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

* Not just a place for finding problems; you can also interact with professionals and even look for employers \(eventuallyâ€¦\)
