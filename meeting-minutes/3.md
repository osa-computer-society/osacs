* [Google Kick Start Round H](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/)
  * This Sunday, 8 pm our time

This week for algorithms, we spent a lot of time talking about some pseudocode for how to solve competitive programming problems and how to break down questions into smaller pieces for the computer!

From now on, I'll also do a bit of an intro to C++ for anybody who's willing to stay a little bit past the 8:30 deadline, but don't feel obligated to come. After getting through some initial details this week, it's just a matter of implementation.
