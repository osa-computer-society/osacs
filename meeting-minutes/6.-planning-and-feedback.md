# 6. Planning and feedback

Since it's currently IB death season and a busy time for many students, today was a brief meeting going over plans for events for the upcoming year. Feel free to discuss any further ideas for events in the comments below. We also began putting together a curated list of resources, which you can find at the link attached!  
  
We also went over the structure of the USACO contests, which you can find on the [Competitions](../resources/competitions.md) page.
