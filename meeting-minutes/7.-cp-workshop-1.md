# 7. CP Workshop 1

Hi everyone, long time no see and happy new year!

For the next six weeks — Jan 18th, 25th, and Feb 1st and 8th — Alex will be doing an "intensive" workshop for anybody interested in learning competitive programming \(CP\). The CCC is coming up in just under a month and the USACO is this weekend.

**Intro to CP** CP is like a mind sport, kind of like math contests or chess tournaments. Essentially, you have a limited amount of time to solve a number of algorithmic problems. Tech companies also use CP questions in their interviews, and studying these concepts will give you a massive head start if you plan to study computer science in university. Also, the CCC is widely recognized by Canadian universities and is considered if you apply to the University of Waterloo.

To practice, check out ["Alex's Algorithms Cookbook"](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zB58viAWTqJ-qzBMuM2euLWxgGAV6kWr?usp=sharing)! It's a work in progress but ultimately we hope for it to be a comprehensive introduction to competitive programming and to cover all of the topics you need to ACE the Junior CCC. It allows you to run code in Python, but the language you use is just a minor detail.

Hope to see you guys tonight! We'll still have another room open if you want to work on your school assignments or anything else as well.

**Week 1:**

* Basic data types
* Fast input and output
* Prefix sum and difference arrays
