# Resources

If you have something you want to add, let us know in person! This page is a work in progress and some of the contest dates may be outdated.

## Misc

Before you go browsing, remember that the Internet is quite literally _gigantic!_ Find a good resource and focus on it instead of wasting your time.

* \*\*\*\*[**awesome**](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)**: ðŸ˜Ž Awesome curations of all kinds of tech-related topics**
  * I highly recommend taking some time to look through and bookmark the ones that interest you
  * \*\*\*\*[awesome-algorithms](https://github.com/tayllan/awesome-algorithms): A  list of awesome resources about algorithms.
* [Ryan's Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/)
  * A great site to learn about all sorts of programming topics.
* [Repl.it](https://repl.it/): An online code editor that allows you to quickly and easily write and share code.
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/): has a variety of really good courses. Unfortunately, they've recently put a lot of their content behind a paywall, but there's still a lot of useful free lessons, especially [Learn How to Code](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-how-to-code) if you're new to programming.
* [https://codecombat.com/](https://codecombat.com/)

## Language-Specific

See our [Tools of the Trade](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10lPVhpyD0kqjodi21XNZE314M5Xc3TOms6DYMfglyEI/edit?usp=sharing) file for information on various IDEs.

### Processing

[Hello Processing](https://hello.processing.org/): An amazing set of video tutorials by Daniel Shiffman \(the creator of Processing\) on getting started with the language.

### Web development

[MDN Tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Tutorials): the Mozilla Development Network is essentially the ultimate authority on all things web, and their tutorials are just as amazing!

## Contests

\(Organized Alphabetically\)

You can find a more comprehensive list [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming). Feel free to let us know about any competitions you write and we'll see if we can help you organize it!

* [American Computer Science League \(ACSL\)](https://www.acsl.org/)
* [Canadian Computing Competition](https://cccgrader.com/)
  * [Past Contests](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc)
  * Has a Junior and Senior Level.
  * 9 February 2021
* [CodeCup](https://www.codecup.nl/intro.php)
  * I don't know much about this one â€” it seems like you're supposed to write a program to play [Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) \(Five in a Row\)
* [Google's Coding Competitions](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/)
  * [Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam)

  * More information will be released soon.
* [USACO](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=instructions)
  * Often features more ad hoc-style problems that test your problem-solving skills rather than memorization of key algorithms.
  * First Contest: December \(TBA\)
  * Second Contest: January \(TBA\)
  * Third Contest: February \(TBA\)

## Design

* [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
  * A great place to learn CSS Flexbox.
* [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)
  * A great place to learn CSS Grid.

## Hacking

## Books

### [Programming Challenges by Skiena and Revila](http://acm.cs.buap.mx/downloads/Programming_Challenges.pdf)

There are many questions throughout that allow you to test your knowledge of algorithms and it covers each topic very thoroughly.

1. Getting started
2. Data Structures
3. Strings
4. Sorting
5. Arithmetic and Algebra
6. Combinatorics
7. Number Theory
8. Backtracking
9. Graph Traversal
10. Graph Algorithms
11. Dynamic Programming
12. Grids
13. Geometry
14. Computational Geometry

### Introduction to Algorithms \(CLRS\)

This is known as the quintessential algorithms textbook. It's over 1000 pages long, but very helpful and begins right from the basics! If you would like access to the book, please talk to us in person and we can help you find a copy. 

## Practice Problems

* [USACO Training Portal](https://train.usaco.org/)
  * > This website includes training for students who typically have a year or two of programming experience and also have interest in 'algorithmic programming'. The techniques taught and drilled here are **difficult**. Expect to spend anywhere from a few minutes to **several hours per problem** if you are an excellent programmer. Beginners will not enjoy these problems, as they require extensive practice and experience. Someday we hope to have an additional lower-level training site for those just beginning in programming.
* [99 problems](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/)
  * Originally written for Prolog but theyâ€™re just questions and can be solved with any language. Starts really easy but gets pretty in-depth, with stuff like binary trees and graph theory like problems.
* [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/)
  * Here you can find an easy-to-access collection of problems from a wide variety of contests, including all past CCCs.
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
  * These are more math-oriented problems, but they're a great way to get started with creative problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
* [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)
  * Kattis is a great collection of a gigantic variety of problems.
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
  * Codewars has an ever-expanding collection of problems that are created by its users and can be translated into different languages by them as well.
* [Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/)
  * Contests: \(Outdated\)
  * October 10: SRM 768 - Sponsored by Google
  * October 19: SRM 769
  * etc.
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
  * Not just a place for finding problems; you can also interact with professionals and even look for employers \(eventuallyâ€¦\)
