WOOHOO!!! Thanks to everyone who came to our first meeting today! We heard some super awesome things and I'm really hyped for the rest of the year. Here's a brief rundown of some stuff we did:

1. A quick Kahoot with programming languages and pokemon... haha sorry I messed up the first question, I'll get a better one ready for next week ;\)

'Gratz to @Edward Han for winning ðŸ¥³ \(we might start giving out prizes ðŸ‘€\)

1. Introductions! Thanks so much to everyone who came and said hi today. We've got people with a huge range of backgrounds and we're super excited to try and make it an amazing year for everyone! Here's a couple topics that got mentioned and that we'll probably start looking at next week:

## Game development

Edward has experience with Unity, so for those of you interested in learning how to program games, he'll probably be leading a small group for doing that! Unity uses the language C\#, which is pretty similar to Java. If you're new to game development, no worries, feel free to hop in if you're interested. \(Oh also, you can get Unity Pro \(along with a ton of other stuff\) for FREE through the GitHub Student Developer Pack! Check out the pins in \#ðŸ“™resources for more info\)

## Programming competitions

I, Alex, will try and set up some practice starting next week for those of you who're interested! I'll probably be demonstrating a bit of C++ along the way, but you can follow along with whatever language you prefer. Feel free to join even if you don't have any experience, I'll do my best to explain concepts from the start.

If you have some free time feel free to sign up on the [USA Computing Olympiad training portal](https://github.com/osa-computing-society/osacs/tree/66018504b37b381eb0733e49a13b9252c5485613/meeting-minutes/train.usaco.org) and read the Introduction and Submitting Solutions pages, and even attempt the first question if you want! \(Don't be intimidated if you have no idea where to start, we'll go over it together next week.\)

## Volunteering

Catherine is going to be leading a volunteering initiative if you're interested in teaching younger students how to code! We haven't fully worked out the details yet, but we'll get back to you as soon as we confirm how we'll be doing this!

1. I talked a bit about arrays and for loops, though I think the comp sci students already saw these in class, haha.
2. We got started with the USACO training portal and talked a bit about programming competitions! \(Just btw, you aren't obligated at all to stay past 8:30, but if we end up going for a bit longer, feel free to stick around :\)

Thank you again so, so much to all of you for showing up! if you weren't able to make it today, no worries at all; just let any of the execs know if you have any questions and keep an eye out for the upcoming events in the agenda message above. I hope you all had a great time and see you next week!
