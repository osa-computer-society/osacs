## Agenda

- Kahoot!

### Competitive Programming (Alex)

- [x] Review "Your Ride Is Here"
- [ ] Talk about the different categories of problems
- [ ] Walkthrough of "Greedy Gift Givers"
- [x] Take a quick peek at problems for next week
- [x] Booleans and bitwise operators

### Game Development (Edward)

- Make sure software is properly set up
- Intro to the Unity editor and finding your way around
- Intro to 3D modeling?

### Code and Chill (Catherine and Caleb)

- Come get some extra help with your school assignments or chat about some code!

## Minutes

Thank you so much for coming everyone! Alex here, I hope the other meets went well! If you have music-related clubs right before ours, we totally understand, but just so that we can try to end at a reasonable time, we'll start at 8:45 and you can hop in at a later time.

Check out [the slides for *Your Ride Is Here*](https://slides.com/alexandercai/your-ride-is-here/fullscreen). Remember, the gist of programming competitions is that the computer is dumb, so you want to break questions down into as simple steps as possible.

Check out [the slides for *Booleans and Bitwise Operators*](https://slides.com/alexandercai/booleans_and_bitwise_operators/fullscreen). Here's the questions I left you guys with:

For a number written in binary:

1. Get the rightmost bit (ones digit)
2. Set the rightmost bit to 1
3. Set the second-right-most bit to 0
4. Toggle the third-right-most bit
5. Set the rightmost 4 bits to 1
6. Set the rightmost 1 to 0

It's hard to give hints without giving away the solution, so do your best and we'll talk about them next week!

Also, try out *Greedy Gift Givers* and *Friday the Thirteenth* on the USACO portal.

The first one is pretty straightforward and you'll be able to finish by simply writing an algorithm that follows the instructions.

The second one, looping through every day and checking if it's Friday the Thirteenth won't cut it. Think about ways you can cut down the number of days you're checking.

Good luck and see you next week!
