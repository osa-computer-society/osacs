# Resources

If you have something you want to add, feel free to let us know in person!

## Misc

Before you go browsing, remember that the Internet is quite literally _gigantic!_ Find a good resource and focus on it instead of wasting your time.

* \*\*\*\*[**awesome**](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)**: ðŸ˜Ž Awesome curations of all kinds of tech-related topics**
  * I highly recommend taking some time to look through and bookmark the ones that interest you
  * \*\*\*\*[awesome-algorithms](https://github.com/tayllan/awesome-algorithms): A  list of awesome resources about algorithms.
* [Ryan's Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/): A great site to learn about all sorts of programming topics
* [Repl.it](https://repl.it/): An online code editor that allows you to quickly and easily write and share code
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) has a variety of really good courses. Unfortunately, they've recently put a lot of their content behind a paywall, but there's still a lot of useful free lessons, especially [Learn How to Code](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-how-to-code) if you're new to programming

## Language-Specific

### Processing

* [Hello Processing](https://hello.processing.org/): An amazing set of video tutorials by Daniel Shiffman \(the creator of Processing\) on getting started with the language.

### Web development

* [MDN Tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Tutorials): the Mozilla Development Network is essentially the ultimate authority on all things web, and their tutorials are just as amazing!
* [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/): A great place to learn CSS Flexbox
* [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/): A great place to learn CSS Grid
* [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/): "Discover the worldâ€™s top designers & creatives"

## Hacking/Cybersecurity

* [TheCyberMentor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnN6dbos5u8)'s YouTube Channel

## Books

Join our Discord server to get in touch with someone with access.

* **Introduction to Algorithms \(CLRS\)**: This is widely recognized as the Bible of algorithms. It's over 1000 pages long, but very helpful and begins right from the basics!
* **Programming Challenges by Skiena and Revila**: There are many questions throughout that allow you to test your knowledge of algorithms and it covers each topic very thoroughly.

## Practice Problems

* \*\*\*\*[**USACO Training Portal**](https://train.usaco.org/)\*\*\*\*
  * > This website includes training for students who typically have a year or two of programming experience and also have interest in 'algorithmic programming'. The techniques taught and drilled here are **difficult**. Expect to spend anywhere from a few minutes to **several hours per problem** if you are an excellent programmer. Beginners will not enjoy these problems, as they require extensive practice and experience. Someday we hope to have an additional lower-level training site for those just beginning in programming.
  * This is what we'll be using for our contest prep group. They have great problems, great explanations, and great coverage of a variety of concepts and algorithms that often show up.
* [**DMOJ**](https://dmoj.ca/)\*\*\*\*
  * Here you can find and practice a huge and accessible collection of problems from a wide variety of contests, including past CCCs and USACOs. Highly recommend.
* [99 problems](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/)
  * Originally written for Prolog but theyâ€™re just questions and can be solved with any language. Starts really easy but gets pretty in-depth, with stuff like binary trees and graph theory like problems.
* [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/)
  * A surprisingly fun platform that takes gamifying learning to the next level.
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
  * These are more math-oriented problems, but they're a great way to get started with creative problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
* [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)
  * A great collection of a gigantic variety of problems.
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
  * Codewars has an ever-expanding collection of problems that are created by its users and can be translated into different languages by them as well.
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
  * Not just a place for finding problems; you can also interact with professionals and even look for employers \(eventuallyâ€¦\)
